# LendingClub Dataset
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

## Goal
The goal is to perform some exploratory analyses on the daya and then build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when the company gets a new potential customer they can assess whether or not the customer is likely to pay back the loan.
